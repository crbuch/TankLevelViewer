# Start server
To bundle project, run "webpack" or "npx webpack" this will transpile the typescript files automatically.

Next run "pip install -r requirements.txt" to install the prerequisites for the server, then "python server.py" to run the webserver
Using webpack-dev-server or static hosting will not work since the local server provides the data.

Make sure to copy the .env file into the directory
