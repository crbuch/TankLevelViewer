# Start server
To start watch mode, run "npx webpack --watch". It's already configured for Typescript

Next run "pip install -r requirements.txt" to install the prerequisites for the server, then "python server.py" to run the webserver.

Using live server or static hosting will not work since the local server provides live data from the api

Make sure to copy the .env file into the directory
